        "value": "Stampli is the only AP automation solution that’s purpose-built for Accounts Payable. It centers all communication, documentation, and workflows on top of each invoice, eliminating the need for workarounds, external communications channels, 3rd-party solutions, or manual AP work inside the ERP. Every activity is logged and auditable, making month-end close simple and efficient. Stampli also offers AP teams full visibility into the status of every single invoice and payment.\n\nAP teams dramatically reduce tedious manual tasks with the help of Billy the Bot™, Stampli’s AI-powered automation. Billy quickly learns how your business AP processes work to automate your most time-consuming activities, including invoice capture, coding, approvals, fraud detection, and automatic sync of invoice data to your ERP.  \n\nBeyond AP, Stampli offers a suite of integrated products that extend the same levels of efficiency, visibility, and control to direct payments (check, ACH, and credit card), your physical and virtual credit card program, vendor management, and more. \n"
